# CloudFlareApp
Application for software engineering internship at CloudFlare

To run:
Using a UNIX system and the proper permissions, input to the command line:
$ sudo ./ping [hostname or IPv4]

I built it to accept a hostname or an IPv4 address. When run on UNIX it should
operate as expected. I tested on Ubuntu for Windows and I was able to run the
program and get the desired results.
